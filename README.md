Collected data from StatLib library, and I wrote a linear regression solver that can accommodate
polynomial basis functions on a single variable. The dataset contains 392 samples. I Split the 
dataset in the first 280 samples for training and the rest 112 samples for testing. 
The accuracy of prediction around 90%. It also able to predict a certain variable value in a specific condition.
